"""
let us do more functions and less crating objects!

currently i do this:
import data from web or long.csv
def transform function 
tranform to new objects
check transform is ok and export to new objects 

now i want to do this 
import data from web or long.csv 
def function that completes transform, check it is ok, and export to new object. all in one script. 
transform to new objects and update the objects themselves, using classes (eg an index class).
