# Theory 

For those accustomed to time series analysis and reading financial charts, this section is not needed. For everyone else, this section provides a point of reference - similar to a glossary. 

## Prices 

## Returns 

## Mean 

## Volatility 

## Correlation 

## Autocorrelation 

## Rolling window

If you have data from day 1 to day 1000, you can split it up into rolling time period of 100 days so that the first windows is day 1 to 100, the second window is day 2 to 101, and so on. 

Using these windows, each of which contain 100 days, we can then compute a statistic such as the mean price for each window. By plotting the mean price on the y-axis and the window's end date on the x-axis, we can see how the mean changed depending on the data that is used. 

Another feature of rolling windows is to smooth data that is volatile, so that the lines in a graph are smoother.

## Rolling correlation 

The correlation matrix looks different depending on which time period we use. To mitigate this weakness, they can be accompanied by graphing the correlation using a rolling window.
