is found in the coins2.ipynb (at least as of 2018-04-21)

0). Calculate performance of top 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.

Jacob did some initial calculations from my dataset and seams like top 10 is good. It’s also a “easy” sell according to me. When we decide on this to everything below : (Håkan and Jacob feel free to add to this list, according to below is what's essential for us to be able to sell this to Nasdaq, but I surely have missed some important points).

1). Total market cap covered by the fund, 5 years back until today show in graph with percentage.

A trend downwards shows that BTC and ETH is not sufficient to give a good market exposure - You need to buy more assets to “capture the market”.

2). Number of different coins in the top 10 last 5 years.

A high number shows that you need to be an active investor even if you only invest in top 10.

3). Number of coins that has been in top 10 that today is out of top 50 and top 100 last 5 years.

A high number of coins going from top 10 to low ranks show that there is high risk with a buy and hold strategy in top 10 if you don’t actively manage your holding.

4). Number of coins that has been in top 10 that now is “dead” last 5 years.

A high number or any number show the market is highly volatile and immature.

5). Number of coins that has died last 5 years.

A high number show the market is highly volatile and immature and speak into the use case of getting lower volatility and active management.

6). Correlations on coins (data I’ve seen shows that there is less correlation in top 15 than there is on the general stock market). Not sure about dates here.

Low correlations means that you need to own several assets to capture the market and just holding one or two assets is not going to ensure good value capturing.

7). Monthly return compared : Index fund, BTC and ETH (show this in graphics where you show the actual percentage return each month for) (suggestion : start 2015 until today)

A higher percent of return on index fund is good for use case.

8). Monthly average return compared : Index fund, BTC and ETH (suggestion : start 2015 until today)

A higher average return on index fund is good for our use case.

9). Yearly return compared : Index fund, BTC and ETH (suggestion : start 2015 until today)

A higher return on index fund is good for our use case.

10). Yearly average return Index fund , BTC and ETH (suggestion : start 2015 until today)

A higher average return on index fund is good for our use case.

11). Volatility Index fund, BTC and ETH (suggestion : start 2015 until today)

Lower volatility on index fund is good for our use case.

12). Percent of trade volume captured by the fund compared to BTC and ETH (last 5 years) 13). Calculate difference between index fund trade volume and BTC + ETH trade volume last 3 years.

The difference is potential lost revenue opportunities for Nasdaq. People are trading assets they don’t give exposure to.

14). Number of in & outs in index (5 years)

The higher number the better.

15). Number of position changes in index (5 years)

The higher number the better.

14). Bonus : Potential hedge to stock, bond markets and other investments (?) Flight to safe haven.

Are crypto and stocks anti-correlated? If so this is a big positive for our use case.
