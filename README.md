## files and folders

The following files and folders are in use:

1. library.py
1. import.py
1. import-check.py
1. functions.py
1. naming-conventions-objects.md
1. transform.py
1. transform-check.py
1. plot.py
1. table.py
1. output/


Every file begin with a short description of what it does.

Output is saved to "output/" folder and the very important plots are saved into "/output/vip/".

The file "naming-conventions-objects.md" describes what convention are followed for creating objects.


## how to understand the code

Read every file in the list above, and read them in that order. The most crucial files are "import.py", "functions.py" and "transform.py".

Reading "plot.py" takes the most time, but it is straight forward to understand the plots if you understand how the data was imported and transformed.

A tip to get up to speed extra quickly is to only read the text after `##` which are my way in python of doing a heading. reading only these first will be like getting to know the structure of the code and learn _what_ is done before reading the details and learning _how_ it is done.

Lastly, there is a file called `coins2_20180523_2103.html`. This data analysis was produced during april and march, and splitting it up into .py files was neccessary to make hakan, simon and others to use the code in the future. The current files are robust, whereas in that .html file the code is a bit all over the place. nonetheless, reading the .html can give some insights into how the code is done. If you feel after having read import.py, functions.py, transform.py that you do not understand it, then the html file can be useful.

## todo

in the files you can search for "todo" and find what needs to be worked on. below is a non-exhaustive list of isses to be fixed. most of them are minor.

- aum start at 100? h√•kan and simon can fix it.
- choose colors
- dead coins: out of those ca 50 coins that has been top10, what is their status now? how many are dead? (first, define dead then count the nr of dead.)
- rollcorr: more thought can be put in here.

it might also be worthwile to let `ret_mat` only contain `tkr_beeninblx` (the tickers that have been in the blx certificate) since it reduces the nr of cols from 1500+ to ca 50. it improves the speed an memory.

## case for crypto in an institutional portfolio

follow these steps to do the data anlaysis

1. familiarize yourself by readng all the current code. this will take an hour or more.
1. import financial assets market cap. i have only imported price and trading volume.
1. write a function that does tolerance rebalncing. this will probably be around 10-15 rows
1. using `ret_mat` you will be able to re-create similar graphs as bitwise have done.
